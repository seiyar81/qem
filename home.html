<h2>Welcome to the Qem website</h2>

<p>Qem stands for Qt Eventable Models.</p>

<p>It provides an easy way of creating and working with models only meant to store data.</p>

<h2>Why Qem ?</h2>

<p>Qem is meant to provide an easy way of writing and working with models, but with one the main feature of Qt : the signals/slots mechanism.</p>

<p>The idea behind Qem is simple : you create a model, you write some data in it, and then you watch it.</p>
