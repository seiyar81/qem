<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>
	Qem mainly uses macros to provide a easy way of writing models.<br />
	
	This is great for providing developer-friendly and easy to use features, but it raises a few problems : <br />
	<ul>
		<li>Auto-completion in your IDE, some work has been done to improve that point, and it should work fine now in most IDE</li>
		<li>Qt's MOC preprocessor doesn't expand macros and as it is the point of Qem it's kind of a big deal !</li>
	</ul>
	The solution to this is for Qem to have his own preprocessor generator.<br />
</p>
	
<h3>qemPreProc</h3>
<p>
	qemPreproc is a simple tool that you need to call (there is also a CMake macro to ease your pain ;) ) <br />
	the header files which contains QEM macros.<br /><br />
	
	This tool will generate empty class definitions with the needed signals to give MOC the expanded versions of our macros.<br />
	
	You can call the tool manually : <br />
	<code>
		qcePreProc [-o&lt;outputFile&gt;] &lt;inputFile&gt;<br />
	</code>
</p>

<h3>Ids</h3>
<p>
A model must be declarated with a defined set of members, each defined with a name and a metatype.<br />
An agency is then used to create and/or delete models.<br />
But you cannot directly access a model object, only its id.<br />

You will use this id to create the following workers : Reader, Writer, Watcher.
